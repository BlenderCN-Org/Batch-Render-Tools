# Batch Render Tools

Batch Render Tools is a series of tools to help doing batch renders in Blender.

Enabling the add-on adds two panels to the 'Render' tab of the 'Properties Editor':
 - Batch Render Tools - The main panel for adding, managing and rendering batch render jobs.
 - Command Prompt Tools - a small panel for quickly opening the command prompt in the Blender installation directory.
